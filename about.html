        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Priyanka — an artist passionate about sketching, painting, and storytelling.<br>
<br>
            My favorite mediums are acrylics and black pencil shading, though I also enjoy experimenting with watercolors and spontaneous ball-pen sketches.<br>
         <br>   
            Sketchbook Sessions is the homely name I chose for my YouTube and Instagram art accounts. The idea is simple — most of my artworks live in sketchbooks. While many artists prefer loose sheets, I have always been a little clumsy and unorganized when it comes to preserving them. Sketchbooks became my safe space, and each one has its own unique identity. (My current one is named Miss Right.)<br>
            <br>
            I have been fond of drawing since childhood and have explored many styles along the way. What began as a hobby grew into an inseparable part of my life. From sketching Hindu gods and goddesses in my early years, to Disney princesses during my teens, my journey eventually brought me to my favorite niche — BTS fanart. I drew my first BTS portrait at 16, and I am still creating them today.</p>
